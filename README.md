# Vending-Machine
An object oriented virtual vending machine program using Java (IntelliJ), that displays inventory from a file and accepts user input for depositing money and making a purchase. The CLI displays a full menu of options and a full menu of items for purchase including how many of those items are available. It allows you to hold a balance when money is deposited and returns change when you are ready to exit the vending machine. A logger is created to keep track of all actions made with a date and time - it logs the amount of money deposited and the updated balance, purchases with the cost of the item and updated balance, and the change returned.
